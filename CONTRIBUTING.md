# Introduction

### Thank You For Contributing!

I want to start by thanking everyone for contributing to EZLBot. It means the world to me to know that there are others who want to help make a vision come true. This was built for everyone and to have everyone help build it is what makes it so amazing.

### Following Guidelines Below Is Extremely Important

These guidelines were created so that everyone could be able to help create something amazing. By having these guidelines it is much easier for everyone to be able to communicate and work together because everyone is following the same format. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Types of Contributions

Contributions come in all shapes and sizes. Some contributers are able to help donate money to help cover costs and build awesome new features. 
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=5949452)
* [PayPal](https://paypal.me/EZLOfficial)
Others contribute by helping develop and send pull requests. Even those that are not able to can help with documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions.

# Ground Rules
### Expectations
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). 

Responsibilities
* Split up each feature you send into separate branches and separate pull requests.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

### Bonus points: Further Help With Contributing

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

# Getting started
### Submitting Contributions
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
  * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
  * Send a pull request
  * Check if the CI found any errors on your pull request and fix errors with more commits, once the Pull Request has no remaining errors, you can leave a comment or add reviewers to alert everyone to check it.

# How to report a bug
### Security Flaws
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Send a direct message to @Skillz4Killz at [Discord](https://discord.gg/VHVY7rb)

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just contact me directly.

### Bug Reports
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What device are you using?
2. What version of Node and Komada? (Private Hosting)
3. What did you do to cause it? The more details the better it is.
4. What did you expected to happen?
5. What actually ended up happening?
